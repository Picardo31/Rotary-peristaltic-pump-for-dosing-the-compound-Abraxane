The administration of medicinal compounds in palliative care has been vital since the beginning of the field of medicine. The
concept of the quantity of dose prescribed by doctors in recent years has created a delicate balance between the evolution of the improvement
of the patients and the level of professional preparation the doctor has. The emergence of technological resources such as infusion machines
that pump small amounts of substances precisely and accurately has made a difference when administering drugs such as Abraxane based
on the characteristics of each patient, either intravenously to the circulatory system, subcutaneous or epidural, obtaining quantifiable results
with the possibility of elaborating a statistical follow-up for each treatment.
However, knowledge about the construction and manufacture of these technological resources has not reached a high degree of diffusion,
making it impossible to use them in regions of the world that do not have the capital to acquire them. The latest OMS report details that
78% of people who need palliative care live in low-income countries, and that, above all, only 14% of these people receive it.
The paper shows the design, analysis and virtual precision prototyping of an infusion machine from a rotary peristaltic pump for the dosing
of drugs in treatments that slow the progress of cancer cell replication. And in this way offer a viable construction possibility for use with
a margin of error of 0:5»ml¼ per dose in mama, pancreas and lung cancer, in addition to offering an optional fourth dose option in case of
having to enter a dosage that is not within the established parameters.
